<p>Oceans due to the release of pollutions into the Ground that eventually find their way into natural uderground water reservoirs known as aquifers. Once the pollutants released infiltrate groundwater,
     they cause contamination.
groundwater Pollution caused by the release of substances,intentionally or accidentally,through anthropogenic activities or natural causes.
    Groundwater pollution is mainly caused by the release of substances, intentionally or accidentally, through anthropogenic activities or natural causes.</p>
    <p>
        The pollutants usually move within aquifers depending on biological, physical, and chemical properties, while diffusion, dispersion, adsorption, and water flow velocity facilitate their movement.
        
        But generally, contaminants progress sluggishly within aquifers, leading to concentrated levels and forming a distinct plume pattern. As the plume spreads, it might connect with springs and ground wells, making the water unsafe for human consumption.</p>

    <h2>2. Surface Water pollution</h2>
    <img src="https://images.thequint.com/thequint%2F2021-11%2Fa66dbad8-7b8d-4b7b-bdae-086d0570a72a%2F09111_pti11_09_2021_000157b.jpg" height="200" width="300">
    <p>
        Surface water pollution includes pollution of rivers, lakes and oceans. A subset of surface water pollution is marine pollution which affects the oceans. Nutrient pollution refers to contamination by excessive inputs of nutrients.

Globally, about 4.5 billion people do not have safely managed sanitation as of 2017, according to an estimate by the Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation. Lack of access to sanitation is concerning and often leads to water pollution, e.g. via the practice of open defecation: during rain events or floods, the human feces are moved from the ground where they were deposited into surface waters. Simple pit latrines may also get flooded during rain events.

As of 2022, Europe and Central Asia account for around 16% of global microplastics discharge into the seas.</p>

<p> Chemical pollutants include heavy metals such as mercury, lead, cadmium, etc., solvents from industries, pesticide run-offs, oil spills from ships, etc. They are poisonous to aquatic life forms and cause infertility and death. The metal wastes are dangerous to humans as well when they get absorbed in our body.</p>
<br>
<p><li> Metals and solvents from industrial work can pollute rivers and lakes. These are poisonous to many forms of aquatic life and may slow their development, make them infertile or even result in death.</li>
   <li> Pesticides are used in farming to control weeds, insects and fungi. Run-offs of these pesticides can cause water pollution and poison aquatic life. Subsequently, birds, humans and other animals may be poisoned if they eat infected fish.<li>
   Petroleum is another form of chemical pollutant that usually contaminates water through oil spills when a ship ruptures. Oil spills usually have only a localised affect on wildlife but can spread for miles. The oil can cause the death of many fish and stick to the feathers of seabirds causing them to lose the ability to fly.</p>

<p>

    Microbiological water pollution refers to the contamination of water by microorganisms, such as bacteria, viruses, and protozoa, which can pose health risks to humans. These tiny organisms can enter water sources through various means, including sewage, agricultural runoff, or wildlife. When people consume or come into contact with water contaminated by these microorganisms, they may suffer from illnesses like diarrhea, cholera, or typhoid.

To prevent microbiological water pollution, it's essential to treat and purify water before consumption. Methods such as chlorination, filtration, and UV treatment can effectively kill or remove these harmful microorganisms. Regular testing of water quality is crucial to ensure that it meets safety standards and does not threaten public health. Proper sewage disposal, improved sanitation practices, and protecting water sources from contamination are also key steps in preventing microbiological water pollution.

<p>Nutrient pollution refers to any excess nitrogen and phosphorus in bodies of water. This kind of pollution has many causes. In some cases, nutrient pollution comes from natural processes, such as the weathering of rocks and the mixing of ocean currents. However, it is most commonly caused by human activities, such as soil erosion from agriculture, stormwater runoff in cities, and everyday operations in industrial facilities.</p><br>

<HR>
<p>Big spills may dominate headlines, but consumers account for the vast majority of oil pollution in our seas, including oil and gasoline that drips from millions of cars and trucks every day. Moreover, nearly half of the estimated 1 million tons of oil that makes its way into marine environments each year comes not from tanker spills but from land-based sources such as factories, farms, and cities. At sea, tanker spills account for about 10 percent of the oil in waters around the world, while regular operations of the shipping industry—through both legal and illegal discharges—contribute about one-third. Oil is also naturally released from under the ocean floor through fractures known as seeps.</p>

    <h2>Control of Water Pollution</h2>
    <p>Control Measures of Water Pollution

        <br>
       <li> Since we have understood the concept of water pollution, let us look into some of the actions taken to control water pollution. Prevention and control of water pollution could be done in so many ways. To start off, it is to plant more trees around water bodies as they naturally help to assimilate and recycle the pollutants.  Some important points are summarized below.</li><br>
        
        
        <li>There is a plant known as 'Water Hyacinth' that absorbs dissolved toxic substances like cadmium and mercury from water bodies, thus actively removing pollutants from water.</li> <br>
        
        <li>It is important to dispose-off waste carefully and not to dump it directly into water bodies, without proper waste treatment. </li><br>
        
       <li> Industries should treat their wastes carefully before disposing of chemicals and other materials into water bodies directly. Sewage treatment plants and wastewater treatment plants in industries are established to treat the water used so it can be safely mixed into the river streams. It also enables water recycling.</li><br>
        
       <li> Using natural fertilizers and pesticides as substitutes for chemical ones is good for plants and water.</li> <br> 
        
       <li> Chemical processes such as coagulation, ion exchange method, reverse osmosis, etc. will greatly reduce the level of water pollution.</li><br> 
        
        <li>Lastly, it is better to reduce the consumption of water in our daily activities and reuse water whenever possible to reduce the overall level of pollution.</li></p>

        <h2>How to Stop Water Pollution</h2>

        <P>Some General Ways to Prevent Water Pollution

           <li> If you can, pick up litter and garbage by hand, and take it to your personal garbage can before it travels into local waterways.</li><br>
            <li>Never put chemicals down the drain. Place them into your outside garbage can or take them to the local authorized center.</li><br>
            <li>Wash your car where the water and soap can go to a dirt or grass area instead of a street and drain to the river or creek.</li><br>

<h1>Important Note!</h1>
<h3> Reuse Waste Water</h3> 
<P>Wastewater reuse, also known as water recycling or reclaimed water, is a sustainable approach to address water scarcity and environmental concerns. It involves treating and repurposing wastewater for various non-potable or even potable applications, reducing the strain on freshwater resources and preventing pollution.

    Wastewater can be treated to remove contaminants, making it safe for irrigation, industrial processes, or even drinking with advanced purification methods. This approach not only conserves precious freshwater supplies but also reduces the pollution of natural water bodies. It also has economic benefits by decreasing water treatment costs and creating new revenue streams through reclaimed water sales.
    
    Wastewater reuse is vital in regions facing water stress, such as arid areas and rapidly growing urban centers. Proper treatment and management are essential to ensure the quality of reused water and protect public health and the environment. As our global population continues to grow and water resources become increasingly strained, wastewater reuse will play a pivotal role in ensuring a sustainable water future.</P>
